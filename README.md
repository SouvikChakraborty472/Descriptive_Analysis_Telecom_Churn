# Descriptive Analysis of Telecom Churn

Welcome to the **Descriptive Analysis of Telecom Churn** repository! This project showcases my expertise in **data analysis**, with a particular focus on **descriptive analysis** of telecom customer churn data. Leveraging **Python programming** and powerful libraries like **pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn**, I've conducted a thorough examination of factors contributing to customer attrition.

## Repository Contents

* **`Main_Notebook.ipynb`**: This is the main Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis, data cleaning, wrangling, visualizations, and derived insights.
* **`TeleCom.csv`**: This CSV file is the raw dataset used for the analysis, providing comprehensive telecom customer information.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth **descriptive analysis** of telecom customer churn. By exploring the raw dataset, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and key characteristics of customers who churn, as well as those who remain. This analysis is crucial for understanding the underlying reasons for churn and informing strategic business decisions.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the key questions and areas explored:

* **Customer Demographics Analysis**: What are the demographic profiles (e.g., age, gender, location) of churning vs. non-churning customers?
* **Service Usage Patterns**: How do service usage metrics (e.g., call duration, data consumption, contract type) differ between churned and retained customers?
* **Billing and Charges Insights**: Are there specific billing patterns or charges that correlate with higher churn rates?
* **Contract and Tenure Impact**: How does contract type and customer tenure influence churn likelihood?
* **Feature Distribution Analysis**: Understanding the distribution of various features across the entire customer base.
* **Identifying Churn Drivers**: What variables exhibit the strongest association with customer churn?

## Data Preparation and Analysis

This section outlines the rigorous steps taken to prepare and analyze the data:

* **Data Cleaning**: Comprehensive handling of missing values, correction of data types, and removal of irrelevant or inconsistent records to ensure data quality.
* **Data Wrangling**: Transformation and restructuring of the raw data, including feature engineering and aggregation, to make it suitable for descriptive analysis and visualization.
* **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of central tendencies, dispersion, and frequencies for key variables to summarize the dataset's characteristics.

## Data Visualization

Effective **data visualization** is paramount to uncovering insights from complex datasets. Utilizing my skills in **matplotlib** and **seaborn**, various compelling plots were created to visually explore the telecom churn data, including:

* **Histograms**: To understand the distribution of numerical variables (e.g., monthly charges, tenure).
* **Bar Plots**: To compare categorical features (e.g., contract type, internet service) against churn status.
* **Box Plots**: To detect outliers and understand the spread of numerical data across different churn groups.
* **Scatter Plots**: To identify relationships and correlations between pairs of continuous variables.
* **Heatmaps**: To visualize the correlation matrix between various numerical features, revealing strong positive or negative relationships.

## Insights and Business Recommendations

Based on the descriptive analysis, several key insights were identified, leading to actionable recommendations for telecom operators:

* **Proactive Retention Strategies**: Pinpointing customer segments with high churn risk enables targeted interventions.
* **Service Offering Optimization**: Insights into popular vs. unpopular services can guide improvements and new offerings.
* **Pricing Model Adjustments**: Understanding how charges affect churn can lead to more competitive and appealing pricing.
* **Customer Experience Enhancement**: Identifying pain points related to specific features or services can inform efforts to improve overall customer satisfaction.
